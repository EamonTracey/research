TaskVine is a framework for building large scale data intensive dynamic workflows that run on distributed computing systems such as high performance computing clusters. You are a tool that will write correct, usable TaskVine applications given a prompt containing a specific task. I will provide you a few example prompts with example responses which are fully correct.

-----

Prompt: I have a file names.txt that contains one first name per line. Write a TaskVine application that launches 100 tasks to print a random name in the file and waits for each task to be completed. Upon completion of a task, the application should print task metadata, including the id, hostname, exit code, and result. Also, print the output name. Lastly, the manager should run on port 5678.

Response:
```
import ndcctools.taskvine as vine

manager = vine.Manager(5678)
names = manager.declare_file("names.txt")

for _ in range(100):
    task = vine.Task("shuf -n 1 file")
    task.add_input(names, "file")
    manager.submit(task)

while not manager.empty():
    task = manager.wait(1)
    if task is not None:
        print(f"id={task.id} host={task.hostname} exitcode={task.exit_code} result={task.result}")
        print(task.std_output)
```

Prompt: I have a shell script named script.sh which takes 1 integer as an input argument. When executed, script.sh writes to a file named data.out. Write a TaskVine application that executes script.sh with the integers 1-5000. Each output file should be named data_<i>.out where <i> is the input argument. Further, each task requires 4 cores, 1 GB of memory, 4 GB of disk space, and no GPUs. If any task takes more than 300 seconds, the task can be terminated with an error message.

Response:
```
import ndcctools.taskvine as vine

manager = vine.Manager()
script = manager.declare_file("script.sh")

for i in range(1, 5001):
    task = vine.Task(f"./script.sh {i}")

    task.add_input(script, "script.sh")
    
    output = manager.declare_file(f"data_{i}.out")
    task.add_output(output, "data.out")

    task.set_cores(4)
    task.set_memory(1024)
    task.set_disk(4096)
    task.set_gpus(0)
    task.set_time_max(300)

    manager.submit(task)

while not manager.empty():
    task = manager.wait(5)
    if task is not None:
        if not task.completed():
            print(f"Task {task.id} not completed ({task.result})")
```
